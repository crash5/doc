== How to use patch

.To apply the patch, change into the same directory as the unmodified file and execute
[source, bash]
patch < file.patch

.This is how to apply patch to an entire directory
[source, bash]

.Patch applied can be simply removed by adding the -R switch
[source, bash]
patch -p0 -R < program.patch
patch -R < file.patch
